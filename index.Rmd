# What you need to know

.pull-left[

- Runs on Python

  - Targeting toolbox is an ArcGIS toolbox (.pyt) purely developed using Python programming language, ArcPy library.

- Toolbox tools

  - It is made of three tools; *Land Suitability*, *Land Similarity* and *Land Statistics* tool.

- Land Suitability Tool

  - Matches suitability criteria with a spatial database. *Suitability maps*: areas where a specific strategy is likely to have a positive impact.

]

.pull-right[

- Land Similarity Tool
  
  - Estimates the potential for out-scaling using socio-ecological characterization and similarity analysis. *Similarity maps*: indicating the wider applicability of the intervention.

- Land Statistics Tool

  - Calculates zonal statistics, e.g. total area/mean covered by human and/or livestock population....,*Output table*: Statistics per suitability/similarity class.

# Land suitability

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[

- Combining suitability maps

- For binary output:
    - min value = optimal from 
    - optimal to = max value
    
- For gradient:
    - min value < optimal from 
    - optimal to > max value

# Land similarity

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[

Compares different geographical layers 

- Assesses to what  extent each pixel is similar to a reference point ~ distance. 

Two methods:

  - Mahalanobis similarity: assess the distance by measuring how many standard deviations away a given value is away from the reference point. 
  
  - Multivariate Environmental Similarity Surfaces (MESS): uses an index that compares the value of a point in space with the distribution of the reference points.

# Land statistics

.pull-left[

![](pic7.png)

]

.pull-right[

- How big is the suitable area?

- How many people live in it?

- What is the average cattle density?

# Use cases
- The tool is ideal for the use by:

  - Students;
  
  - Educators; 
  
  - Development practitioners.
